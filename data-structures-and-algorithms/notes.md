# Data structures and algorithms in Python

A data structure is a way to storing and organizing data according to a certain format or structure.

## Data structures in Python

Python is equipped with several built-in data structures to help us efficiently handle large amounts of data.

The four primary built-in data structures offered in Python3 are:

- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set

### Lists

#### Structure

The list is perhaps the most commonly used data structure in Python. It allows us to store elements of different data types in one container.

The contents of a list are enclosed by square brackets, [ ].

Lists are _ordered_, like strings. Elements are stored linearly at a specific index.

</p>

A string was a collection of characters indexed in a linear fashion. A list is the same except that it can contain any type of data, even another list!

#### Creating a list

```python
jon_snow = ["Jon Snow", "Winterfell", 30]
print(jon_snow)

# Indexing
print(jon_snow[0])

# Length
print(len(jon_snow))

```

Output:

```
['Jon Snow', 'Winterfell', 30]
Jon Snow
3
```

The beauty of lists lies in the fact that we are not bound to one type of data. Lists are mutable, which further expands their functionality:

```python
jon_snow = ["Jon Snow", "Winterfell", 30]
print(jon_snow[2])
jon_snow[2] += 3
print(jon_snow[2])
```

#### Using range()

A range can further be converted into a list by using the list() casting.

```python
num_seq = range(0, 10)  # A sequence from 0 to 9
num_list = list(num_seq)  # The list() method casts the sequence into a list
print(num_list)

num_seq = range(3, 20, 3)  # A sequence from 3 to 19 with a step of 3
print(list(num_seq))
```

#### List-ception!

Here's an example of lists inside another list:

```python
world_cup_winners = [[2006, "Italy"], [2010, "Spain"],
                     [2014, "Germany"], [2018, "France"]]
print(world_cup_winners)
```

Output:

```
[[2006, 'Italy'], [2010, 'Spain'], [2014, 'Germany'], [2018, 'France']]
```

##### Sequential indexing

To access the elements of a list or a string which exists inside another list, we can use the concept of sequential indexing.

```python
world_cup_winners = [[2006, "Italy"], [2010, "Spain"],
                     [2014, "Germany"], [2018, "France"]]
print(world_cup_winners[1])
print(world_cup_winners[1][1])  # Accessing 'Spain'
print(world_cup_winners[1][1][0])  # Accessing 'S'
```

#### Merging lists

The simplest way is to use the + operator like we did for strings:

```python
part_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
part_B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
merged_list = part_A + part_B
print(merged_list)
```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Alternatively, we could use the **extend()** property of a list to add the elements of one list at the end of another.

```python
part_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
part_B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
part_A.extend(part_B)
print(part_A)
```

#### Common list operations

##### Adding elements

The **append()** method can be used to add a new element at the end of a list.

```
a_list.append(newElement)
```

Example:

```python
num_list = []  # Empty list
num_list.append(1)
num_list.append(2)
num_list.append(3)
print(num_list)
```

In the code above, we create an empty list. This can always be done by simply using empty square brackets [ ].

To add an element at a particular index in the list, we can use the **inser()** method.

```
aList.insert(index, newElement)
```

If a value already exists at that index, the whole list from that value onwards will be shifted one step to the right:

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
num_list.insert(3, 4)  # Inserting 4 at the 3rd index. 5 and 6 shifted ahead
print(num_list)
```

##### Removing elements

The counterpart of **append()** is **pop()**, which removes the last element from the list. We can store this popped element in a variable.

```python
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
last_house = houses.pop()
print(last_house)
print(houses)
```

If we need to delete a particular value from a list, we can use the **remove()** method.

```
aList.remove(element_to_be_deleted)
```

```python
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
print(houses)
houses.remove("Ravenclaw")
print(houses)

# For nested lists
populations = [["Winterfell", 10000], ["King's Landing", 50000],
               ["Iron Islands", 5000]]
print(populations)
populations.remove(["King's Landing", 50000])
print(populations)
```

Output:

```
['Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Ravenclaw', 'Slytherin', 'Ravenclaw']
['Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Slytherin', 'Ravenclaw']
[['Winterfell', 10000], ["King's Landing", 50000], ['Iron Islands', 5000]]
[['Winterfell', 10000], ['Iron Islands', 5000]]
```

##### List slicing

It is used to obtain a portion of a list given the start and end indices. Slicing a list gives us a sublist:

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(num_list[2:5])
print(num_list[0::2])
```

Output:

```
[3, 4, 5]
[1, 3, 5, 7]
```

##### Index search

With lists its really easy to access a value through its index. However, the opposite operation is also possible where we can find the index of a given value.

For this, weâ€™ll use the **index()** method:

```python
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Beirut"]
print(cities.index("Los Angeles"))  # It is at the 2nd index
```

Output : 2

If we just want to verify the existence of an element in a list, we can use the in operator:

```python
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Beirut"]
print("London" in cities)
print("Moscow" not in cities)
```

Output:

```
True
True
```

##### List sort

A list can be sorted in ascending order using the **sort()** method. Sorting can be done alphabetically or numerically depending on the content of the list:

```python
num_list = [20, 40, 10, 50.4, 30, 100, 5]
num_list.sort()
print(num_list)
```

Output:

```
[5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.4, 100]
```

#### List comprehension

List comprehension is a technique that uses a for loop and a condition to create a new list from an existing one. The result is always a new list, so it's a good practice to assign list comprehension to a new variable.

##### Structure

```
[expression for loop if condition]
```

- The **expression** is an operation used to create elements in the new list.
- The **for** **loop** will iterate an existing list. The iterator will be used in the **expression**.
- New elements will only be added to the new list when the **if condition** is fulfilled. This component is optional.

Example:

Let's create a new list whose values are the doubles of the values of an existing list.

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
nums_double = []

for n in nums:
  nums_double.append(n * 2)
  
```

Let's break down the loop above into the three components of a list comprehension. The expression is equivalent to ** n \* 2** since it's used to create each value in the new list.

Our for loop is **for n in nums**, where **n** is the iterator.

An if condition doesn't exist in this case.

Converting...

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# List comprehension
nums_double = [n * 2 for n in nums]

```

We could add a condition:

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# List comprehension
nums_double = [n * 2 for n in nums if n % 4 == 0]

```

##### Using multiple lists

List comprehension can also be performed on more than one list. The number of for loops in the comprehension will correspond to the number of lists we're using.

Let's write a list comprehension which creates tuples out of the values in two lists when their sum is greater than 100. These tuples are the elemnents of the new list.

```python
list1 = [30, 50, 110, 40, 15, 75]
list2 = [10, 60, 20, 50]

sum_list = [(n1, n2) for n1 in list1 for n2 in list2 if n1 + n2 > 100]
```

### Tuples

#### Structure

A tuple is very similar to a list, except for the fact that its contents cannot be changed. In other words, a tuple is **immutable**. However, it can contain mutable elements like a list. These elements can be altered.

The contents of a tuple are enclosed in parentheses, (). They are also ordered.

</p>


#### Creating a tuple

Tuples can be created similar to lists. All the indexing and slicing operations apply to it as well:

```python
car = ("Ford", "Raptor", 2019, "Red")
print(car)

# Length
print(len(car))

# Indexing
print(car[1])

# Slicing
print(car[2:])
```

Output:

```
('Ford', 'Raptor', 2019, 'Red')
4
Raptor
(2019, 'Red')
```

#### Merging tuples

Tuples can be merged using the + operator.

#### Nested tuples

Instead of merging two tuples, we can create a new tuple with tuples as its members.

```python
hero1 = ("Batman", "Bruce Wayne")
hero2 = ("Wonder Woman", "Diana Prince")
awesome_team = (hero1, hero2)
print(awesome_team)
```

Output:

```
(('Batman', 'Bruce Wayne'), ('Wonder Woman', 'Diana Prince'))
```

#### Search

We can check whether an element exists in a tuple by using the **in** operator as well.

The **index()** function can give us the index of a particular value:

```python
cities = ("London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Tokyo")
print(cities.index("Tokyo"))
```

Output: 3

#### Immutability

Since tuples are immutable, we can't add or delete elements from them. Furthermore, it isn't possible to append another tuple to an existing tuple.

### Dictionaries

#### Structure

It has a slightly more complex structure.

A **dictionary** stores **key-value** pairs, where each unique key is an **index** which holds the value associated with it.

Dictionaries are **unordered**. In Python, we must put the dictionary's content inside curly brackets, {}.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180580056-5ffc3f1a-6a14-4034-bf29-95ac2293a99f.png"/>
</p>

A key-value pair is written in the following format:

```
key:value
```

#### Creating a dictionary

Let's create an empty dictionary and a simple **phone_book** using the dictionary data structure.

```python
empty_dict = {} # Empty dictionary
print(empty_dict)

phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book) 
```

Output:

```
{}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734}
```

Note that since the dictionary is an unordered data structure, the order of the output will not necessarily match the order in which we wrote the entries. Key-value pairs are accessed in a random or unordered manner. 

The dictionary above could also be written in the same line. Dividing it into lines only increases readability.

#### The dict() constructor

Don't worry about the term constructor for now. Think of it as an operation which gives us a dictionary.

If our keys are simple strings without special characters, we can create entries in the constructor. In that case, values will be assigned to keys using the = operator. A popular practice is to create an empty dictionary and add entries later.

Let's refactor the example above to make it work with dict().

```python
empty_dict = dict()  # Empty dictionary
print(empty_dict)

phone_book = dict(Batman=468426, Cersei=237734, Ghostbusters=44678)
# Keys will automatically be converted to strings
print(phone_book)

# Alternative approach
phone_book = dict([('Batman', 468426),
                   ('Cersei', 237734),
                   ('Ghostbusters', 44678)])
print(phone_book)
```

The **keys** and **values** can have any of the basic data types or structures we've studied. Two keys can have the same value. However, it is crucial that all keys are unique.

#### Accessing values

We can access a value by enclosing its key in square brackets [ ]. Alternatively, we can use the get() method as follows:

```
a_dictionary.get(key)
```

Let's build upon our previous example:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book["Cersei"])
print(phone_book.get("Ghostbusters"))
```

Output:

```
237734
44678
```
