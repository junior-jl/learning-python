## Introduction

- Python is a high level programming language;
- The most recent version of Python is Python 3;
- It is a general purpose language;
- It is an interpreted language: the code is converted to bytecode line-by-line.

## Hello, world

- To print something on screen, we use the *print* statement.

```py
print("Hello, world")
```

- As a standart, _print_ always print a newline at the end of the string. To choose what comes at the end, we do:

```py
print("Hello, ", end="")
print("world")
```


## Comments

- Comments in Python are written with the # character.

- Docstrings are, in essence, multiline comments. They are encapsulated by triple quotes

```py
# This is a comment.
''' This 
is
also
a 
comment.
'''
```

Also... Python doesn't care if you use single or double quotes. They are equivalent.
