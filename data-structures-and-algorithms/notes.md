# Data structures and algorithms in Python

A data structure is a way to storing and organizing data according to a certain format or structure.

## Data structures in Python

Python is equipped with several built-in data structures to help us efficiently handle large amounts of data.

The four primary built-in data structures offered in Python3 are:

- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set

### Lists

#### Structure

The list is perhaps the most commonly used data structure in Python. It allows us to store elements of different data types in one container.

The contents of a list are enclosed by square brackets, [ ].

Lists are _ordered_, like strings. Elements are stored linearly at a specific index.

<p align="center">

</p>

A string was a collection of characters indexed in a linear fashion. A list is the same except that it can contain any type of data, even another list!

#### Creating a list

```python
jon_snow = ["Jon Snow", "Winterfell", 30]
print(jon_snow)

# Indexing
print(jon_snow[0])

# Length
print(len(jon_snow))

```

Output:

```
['Jon Snow', 'Winterfell', 30]
Jon Snow
3
```

The beauty of lists lies in the fact that we are not bound to one type of data. Lists are mutable, which further expands their functionality:

```python
jon_snow = ["Jon Snow", "Winterfell", 30]
print(jon_snow[2])
jon_snow[2] += 3
print(jon_snow[2])
```

#### Using range()

A range can further be converted into a list by using the list() casting.

```python
num_seq = range(0, 10)  # A sequence from 0 to 9
num_list = list(num_seq)  # The list() method casts the sequence into a list
print(num_list)

num_seq = range(3, 20, 3)  # A sequence from 3 to 19 with a step of 3
print(list(num_seq))
```

#### List-ception!

Here's an example of lists inside another list:

```python
world_cup_winners = [[2006, "Italy"], [2010, "Spain"],
                     [2014, "Germany"], [2018, "France"]]
print(world_cup_winners)
```

Output:

```
[[2006, 'Italy'], [2010, 'Spain'], [2014, 'Germany'], [2018, 'France']]
```

##### Sequential indexing

To access the elements of a list or a string which exists inside another list, we can use the concept of sequential indexing.

```python
world_cup_winners = [[2006, "Italy"], [2010, "Spain"],
                     [2014, "Germany"], [2018, "France"]]
print(world_cup_winners[1])
print(world_cup_winners[1][1])  # Accessing 'Spain'
print(world_cup_winners[1][1][0])  # Accessing 'S'
```

#### Merging lists

The simplest way is to use the + operator like we did for strings:

```python
part_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
part_B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
merged_list = part_A + part_B
print(merged_list)
```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Alternatively, we could use the **extend()** property of a list to add the elements of one list at the end of another.

```python
part_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
part_B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
part_A.extend(part_B)
print(part_A)
```

#### Common list operations

##### Adding elements

The **append()** method can be used to add a new element at the end of a list.

```
a_list.append(newElement)
```

Example:

```python
num_list = []  # Empty list
num_list.append(1)
num_list.append(2)
num_list.append(3)
print(num_list)
```

In the code above, we create an empty list. This can always be done by simply using empty square brackets [ ].

To add an element at a particular index in the list, we can use the **inser()** method.

```
aList.insert(index, newElement)
```

If a value already exists at that index, the whole list from that value onwards will be shifted one step to the right:

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
num_list.insert(3, 4)  # Inserting 4 at the 3rd index. 5 and 6 shifted ahead
print(num_list)
```

##### Removing elements

The counterpart of **append()** is **pop()**, which removes the last element from the list. We can store this popped element in a variable.

```python
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
last_house = houses.pop()
print(last_house)
print(houses)
```

If we need to delete a particular value from a list, we can use the **remove()** method.

```
aList.remove(element_to_be_deleted)
```

```python
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
print(houses)
houses.remove("Ravenclaw")
print(houses)

# For nested lists
populations = [["Winterfell", 10000], ["King's Landing", 50000],
               ["Iron Islands", 5000]]
print(populations)
populations.remove(["King's Landing", 50000])
print(populations)
```

Output:

```
['Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Ravenclaw', 'Slytherin', 'Ravenclaw']
['Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Slytherin', 'Ravenclaw']
[['Winterfell', 10000], ["King's Landing", 50000], ['Iron Islands', 5000]]
[['Winterfell', 10000], ['Iron Islands', 5000]]
```

##### List slicing

It is used to obtain a portion of a list given the start and end indices. Slicing a list gives us a sublist:

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(num_list[2:5])
print(num_list[0::2])
```

Output:

```
[3, 4, 5]
[1, 3, 5, 7]
```

##### Index search

With lists its really easy to access a value through its index. However, the opposite operation is also possible where we can find the index of a given value.

For this, weâ€™ll use the **index()** method:

```python
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Beirut"]
print(cities.index("Los Angeles"))  # It is at the 2nd index
```

Output : 2

If we just want to verify the existence of an element in a list, we can use the in operator:

```python
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Beirut"]
print("London" in cities)
print("Moscow" not in cities)
```

Output:

```
True
True
```

##### List sort

A list can be sorted in ascending order using the **sort()** method. Sorting can be done alphabetically or numerically depending on the content of the list:

```python
num_list = [20, 40, 10, 50.4, 30, 100, 5]
num_list.sort()
print(num_list)
```

Output:

```
[5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.4, 100]
```

#### List comprehension

List comprehension is a technique that uses a for loop and a condition to create a new list from an existing one. The result is always a new list, so it's a good practice to assign list comprehension to a new variable.

##### Structure

```
[expression for loop if condition]
```

- The **expression** is an operation used to create elements in the new list.
- The **for** **loop** will iterate an existing list. The iterator will be used in the **expression**.
- New elements will only be added to the new list when the **if condition** is fulfilled. This component is optional.

Example:

Let's create a new list whose values are the doubles of the values of an existing list.

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
nums_double = []

for n in nums:
  nums_double.append(n * 2)
  
```

Let's break down the loop above into the three components of a list comprehension. The expression is equivalent to ** n \* 2** since it's used to create each value in the new list.

Our for loop is **for n in nums**, where **n** is the iterator.

An if condition doesn't exist in this case.

Converting...

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# List comprehension
nums_double = [n * 2 for n in nums]

```

We could add a condition:

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# List comprehension
nums_double = [n * 2 for n in nums if n % 4 == 0]

```

##### Using multiple lists

List comprehension can also be performed on more than one list. The number of for loops in the comprehension will correspond to the number of lists we're using.

Let's write a list comprehension which creates tuples out of the values in two lists when their sum is greater than 100. These tuples are the elemnents of the new list.

```python
list1 = [30, 50, 110, 40, 15, 75]
list2 = [10, 60, 20, 50]

sum_list = [(n1, n2) for n1 in list1 for n2 in list2 if n1 + n2 > 100]
```

### Tuples

#### Structure

A tuple is very similar to a list, except for the fact that its contents cannot be changed. In other words, a tuple is **immutable**. However, it can contain mutable elements like a list. These elements can be altered.

The contents of a tuple are enclosed in parentheses, (). They are also ordered.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180579633-4eb93f46-e11d-4f45-9c10-244b48abe5bb.png"/>
</p>


#### Creating a tuple

Tuples can be created similar to lists. All the indexing and slicing operations apply to it as well:

```python
car = ("Ford", "Raptor", 2019, "Red")
print(car)

# Length
print(len(car))

# Indexing
print(car[1])

# Slicing
print(car[2:])
```

Output:

```
('Ford', 'Raptor', 2019, 'Red')
4
Raptor
(2019, 'Red')
```

#### Merging tuples

Tuples can be merged using the + operator.

#### Nested tuples

Instead of merging two tuples, we can create a new tuple with tuples as its members.

```python
hero1 = ("Batman", "Bruce Wayne")
hero2 = ("Wonder Woman", "Diana Prince")
awesome_team = (hero1, hero2)
print(awesome_team)
```

Output:

```
(('Batman', 'Bruce Wayne'), ('Wonder Woman', 'Diana Prince'))
```

#### Search

We can check whether an element exists in a tuple by using the **in** operator as well.

The **index()** function can give us the index of a particular value:

```python
cities = ("London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Tokyo")
print(cities.index("Tokyo"))
```

Output: 3

#### Immutability

Since tuples are immutable, we can't add or delete elements from them. Furthermore, it isn't possible to append another tuple to an existing tuple.

### Dictionaries

#### Structure

It has a slightly more complex structure.

A **dictionary** stores **key-value** pairs, where each unique key is an **index** which holds the value associated with it.

Dictionaries are **unordered**. In Python, we must put the dictionary's content inside curly brackets, {}.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180580056-5ffc3f1a-6a14-4034-bf29-95ac2293a99f.png"/>
</p>

A key-value pair is written in the following format:

```
key:value
```

#### Creating a dictionary

Let's create an empty dictionary and a simple **phone_book** using the dictionary data structure.

```python
empty_dict = {} # Empty dictionary
print(empty_dict)

phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book) 
```

Output:

```
{}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734}
```

Note that since the dictionary is an unordered data structure, the order of the output will not necessarily match the order in which we wrote the entries. Key-value pairs are accessed in a random or unordered manner. 

The dictionary above could also be written in the same line. Dividing it into lines only increases readability.

#### The dict() constructor

Don't worry about the term constructor for now. Think of it as an operation which gives us a dictionary.

If our keys are simple strings without special characters, we can create entries in the constructor. In that case, values will be assigned to keys using the = operator. A popular practice is to create an empty dictionary and add entries later.

Let's refactor the example above to make it work with dict().

```python
empty_dict = dict()  # Empty dictionary
print(empty_dict)

phone_book = dict(Batman=468426, Cersei=237734, Ghostbusters=44678)
# Keys will automatically be converted to strings
print(phone_book)

# Alternative approach
phone_book = dict([('Batman', 468426),
                   ('Cersei', 237734),
                   ('Ghostbusters', 44678)])
print(phone_book)
```

The **keys** and **values** can have any of the basic data types or structures we've studied. Two keys can have the same value. However, it is crucial that all keys are unique.

#### Accessing values

We can access a value by enclosing its key in square brackets [ ]. Alternatively, we can use the get() method as follows:

```
a_dictionary.get(key)
```

Let's build upon our previous example:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book["Cersei"])
print(phone_book.get("Ghostbusters"))
```

Output:

```
237734
44678
```

#### Dictionary operations

##### Adding/Updating entries

We can add entries in a dictionary by simply assigning a value to a key. Python automatically creates the entry. If a value already exists at this key, it will be updated:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book)

phone_book["Godzilla"] = 46394  # New entry
print(phone_book)

phone_book["Godzilla"] = 9000  # Updating entry
print(phone_book)
```

Output:

```
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Godzilla': 46394, 'Cersei': 237734}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Godzilla': 9000, 'Cersei': 237734}
```

##### Removing entries

To delete an entry, we can use the **del** keyword.

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book)

del phone_book["Batman"]
print(phone_book)
```

If we want to use the deleted value, the pop() or popitem() methods would work better:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book)

cersei = phone_book.pop("Cersei")
print(phone_book)
print(cersei)

# Removes and returns the last inserted pair, as a tuple
# In Python versions before 3.7, popitem() removes and returns the random item
lastAdded = phone_book.popitem()
print(lastAdded)
```

Output:

```
{'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734, 'Ghostbusters': 44678}
{'Batman': 468426, 'Ghostbusters': 44678}
237734
('Ghostbusters', 44678)
```

##### Length of a dictionary

Similar to lists and tuples, we can calculate the length of a dictionary using **len()**:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(len(phone_book))
```

##### Checking key existence

The in keyword can be used to check if a key exists in a dictionary.

##### Copying contents

To copy the contents of one dictionary to another, we can use the **update()** operation.

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}

second_phone_book = {"Catwoman": 67423, "Jaime": 237734, "Godzilla": 37623}

# Add secondphone_book to phone_book
phone_book.update(second_phone_book)
print(phone_book)
```

##### Dictionary comprehension

It works very similar to list comprehensions. However, to iterate the dictionary, we'll use the **dict.items()** operation which turns a dictionary into a list of **(key, value)** tuples. Here's a simple example where the keys of the original dictionary are squared and '!' is appended to each string value:

```python
houses = {1: "Gryffindor", 2: "Slytherin", 3: "Hufflepuff", 4: "Ravenclaw"}
new_houses = {n**2: house + "!" for (n, house) in houses.items()}
print(houses)
print(new_houses)
```

Output:

```
{1: 'Gryffindor', 2: 'Slytherin', 3: 'Hufflepuff', 4: 'Ravenclaw'}
{16: 'Ravenclaw!', 1: 'Gryffindor!', 4: 'Slytherin!', 9: 'Hufflepuff!'}
```

### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of data items.

The data is not indexed, so we can't access elements using indices or get(). This is probably the simplest data structure in Python. We can think of it as a bag containing random items.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581245-f7adef2e-09de-4275-90f0-460cdf5a2385.png"/>
</p>

Mutable data structures like lists or dictionaries can't be added to a set. However, adding a tuple is perfectly fine. A set is perfect when we simply need to keep track of the existence of items.

It doesn't allow duplicates, which means that we can convert another data structure to a set to remove any duplicates.

#### Creating a set

The contents of a set are encapsulated in curly brackets, {}. Like all data structures, the length of a set can be calculated using len().

#### The set() constructor

It is an alternate way of creating sets.

```python
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)

random_set = set({"Educative", 1408, 3.142, (True, False)})
print(random_set)
```

Output:

```
set()
{1408, (True, False), 3.142, 'Educative'}
```

#### Adding elements

To add a single item, we can use the **add()** method. To add multiple items, we'd have to use **update()**.

The input for update() must be another set, list, tuple, or string.

```python
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)

empty_set.add("hi")
print(empty_set)

empty_set.update([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "hi")
print(empty_set)
```

Output:

```
set()
{'hi'}
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 'hi', 'i', 'h'}
```

#### Deleting elements

The **discard()** or **remove()** operations can be used to delete a particular item from a set.

```python
random_set = set({"Educative", 1408, 3.142, (True, False)})
print(random_set)

random_set.discard(1408)
print(random_set)

random_set.remove((True, False))
print(random_set)
```

The **remove()** method generates an error if the item is not found, unlike the **discard()** method.

#### Iterating a set

The **for** loop can be used on unordered data structures like sets. However, we wouldnâ€™t know the order in which the iterator moves meaning elements will be picked randomly.

In the example below, weâ€™ll take the elements of a set and append them to a list if they are odd:

```python
odd_list = [1, 3, 5, 7]
unordered_set = {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}

print(unordered_set)

for num in unordered_set:
    if(not num % 2 == 0):
        odd_list.append(num)

print(odd_list)
```

Output:

```
{9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]
```

#### Set theory operations

- Union
- Intersection
- Difference

##### Union

A union of two sets is the collection of all unique elements from both sets.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581675-facb74a2-505f-4c48-979d-653b9ceb9b4b.png"/>
</p>

In Python, union can be performed using either the pipe operator \|, or the **union()** method.

```python
set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_B = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

print(set_A | set_B)
print(set_A.union(set_B))
print(set_B.union(set_A))
```

Output:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b'}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b'}
{'a', 1, 2, 3, 4, 'd', 'c', 'b'}
```

##### Intersection

The intersection of two sets is the collection of unique elements which are common between them.

In Python, intersection can be performed using either the \& operator or the **intersection()** method.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581806-b5d4ceed-3516-46fa-8fc8-0eeec540e245.png"/>
</p>

```python
set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_B = {2, 8, 4, 16}

print(set_A & set_B)
print(set_A.intersection(set_B))
print(set_B.intersection(set_A))
```

Output:

```
{2, 4}
{2, 4}
{2, 4}
```

##### Difference

The difference between two sets is the collection of all unique elements present in the first set but not in the second.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581868-ec67c958-dff5-47d9-bb05-40f60974bef7.png"/>
</p>

          
In Python, the difference between two sets can be found using either the - operator or the **difference()** method.

```python
set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_B = {2, 8, 4, 16}


print(set_A - set_B)
print(set_A.difference(set_B))

print(set_B - set_A)
print(set_B.difference(set_A))
```

Output:

```
{1, 3}
{1, 3}
{16, 8}
{16, 8}
```

### Data structure conversions

#### Explicit conversion

The template for explicitly converting from one data structure to another is as follows:

```
destination_structure_name(source_structure_object)
```

#### Converting to a list

We can converte a tuple, set, or dictionary to a list using the **list()** constructor. In the case of a dictionary, only the keys will be converted to a list.

```python
star_wars_tup = ("Anakin", "Darth Vader", 1000)
print(star_wars_tup)
star_wars_set = {"Anakin", "Darth Vader", 1000}
print(star_wars_set)
star_wars_dict = {1: "Anakin", 2: "Darth Vader", 3: 1000}
print(star_wars_dict)

star_wars_list = list(star_wars_tup)  # Converting from tuple
print(star_wars_list)

star_wars_list = list(star_wars_set)  # Converting from set
print(star_wars_list)

star_wars_list = list(star_wars_dict)  # Converting from dictionary
print(star_wars_list)
```

Output:

```
('Anakin', 'Darth Vader', 1000)
{1000, 'Anakin', 'Darth Vader'}
{1: 'Anakin', 2: 'Darth Vader', 3: 1000}
['Anakin', 'Darth Vader', 1000]
[1000, 'Anakin', 'Darth Vader']
[1, 2, 3]
```

We can also use the **dict.items()** method to convert a dictionary into an iterable of **(key, value)** tuples. This can further be cast into a list of tuples using **list()**:

```python
star_wars_dict = {1: "Anakin", 2: "Darth Vader", 3: 1000}
print(star_wars_dict)

star_wars_list = list(star_wars_dict.items())
print(star_wars_list)
```

Output:

```
{1: 'Anakin', 2: 'Darth Vader', 3: 1000}
[(1, 'Anakin'), (2, 'Darth Vader'), (3, 1000)]
```

#### Converting to a tuple

Any data structure can be converted to a tuple using the **tuple()** constructor. In the case of a dictionary, only the keys will be converted to a tuple.

```python
star_wars_list = ["Anakin", "Darth Vader", 1000]
print(star_wars_list)
star_wars_set = {"Anakin", "Darth Vader", 1000}
print(star_wars_set)
star_wars_dict = {1: "Anakin", 2: "Darth Vader", 3: 1000}
print(star_wars_dict)

star_wars_tup = tuple(star_wars_list)  # Converting from list
print(star_wars_tup)

star_wars_tup = tuple(star_wars_set)  # Converting from set
print(star_wars_tup)

star_wars_tup = tuple(star_wars_dict)  # Converting from dictionary
print(star_wars_tup)
```

Output:

```
['Anakin', 'Darth Vader', 1000]
{1000, 'Darth Vader', 'Anakin'}
{1: 'Anakin', 2: 'Darth Vader', 3: 1000}
('Anakin', 'Darth Vader', 1000)
(1000, 'Darth Vader', 'Anakin')
(1, 2, 3)
```

#### Converting to a set

The **set()** constructor can be used to create a set out of any other data structure. In the case of a dictionary, only the keys will be converted to a set.

#### Converting to a dictionary

**The dict()** constructor cannot be used in the same way as the others because it requires key-value pairs. Hence, the data must be stored in a format where **pairs** exist.

```python
star_wars_list = [[1,"Anakin"], [2,"Darth Vader"], [3, 1000]]
print (star_wars_list)
star_wars_tup = ((1, "Anakin"), (2, "Darth Vader"), (3, 1000))
print (star_wars_tup)
star_wars_set = {(1, "Anakin"), (2, "Darth Vader"), (3, 1000)}
print (star_wars_set)

star_wars_dict = dict(star_wars_list) # Converting from list
print(star_wars_dict)

star_wars_dict = dict(star_wars_tup) # Converting from tuple
print(star_wars_dict)

star_wars_dict = dict(star_wars_set) # Converting from set
print(star_wars_dict)
```

Output:

```
[[1, 'Anakin'], [2, 'Darth Vader'], [3, 1000]]
((1, 'Anakin'), (2, 'Darth Vader'), (3, 1000))
{(3, 1000), (2, 'Darth Vader'), (1, 'Anakin')}
{1: 'Anakin', 2: 'Darth Vader', 3: 1000}
{1: 'Anakin', 2: 'Darth Vader', 3: 1000}
{1: 'Anakin', 2: 'Darth Vader', 3: 1000}
```

## Stack

The data structure stack is very similar to a physical stack that you'd most likely be familiar with. The stack data structure allows us to place any programming artifact, variable or object on it.

### Stack operations

#### Push

The operation to insert elements in a stack is called **push**. When we push the book on a stack, we put the book on the previous _top_ element, which means that the new book becomes the _top_ element.

#### Pop

Popping is when we take the top book of the stack and put it down. This implies that when we remove an element from the stack, the stack follows the _First-in, Last out_ property. This means that the top element is removed when we perform the pop operation.

#### Peek

Another thing that we can do is view the top element of the stack so we can ask the data structure: "What's the top element?" and it can give that to us using the _peek_ operation.

Now we are going to create a stack class, and the constructor of the class is going to initialize a Python list.

```python
"""
Stack Data Structure.
"""
class Stack():
  def __init__(self):
    self.items = []
```

We are defining a class variable **items**, and assigning it to an empty list. **self.items** is created when we create a stack object so now let's create the **push** method.

```python
"""
Stack Data Structure
"""
class Stack():
  def __init__(self):
    self.items = []
  
  def push(self, item):
    self.items.append(item)
   
```

Implementing the pop method:

```python
"""
Stack Data Structure.
"""
class Stack():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)				

    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop()
```

We also create a method called **get_stack()** that will return the **items** list.

```python
"""
Stack Data Structure.
"""
class Stack():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)				

    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop()

    def get_stack(self):
        return self.items
```

Another helpful method we could have is a method called **is_empty**. It will return whether or not the stack is empty.

```python
class Stack():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)				

    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop()
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []
        
    def get_stack(self):
        return self.items
        
```

To finish, we have the peek operation which tells us the topmost element of the stack.

```python
"""
Stack Data Structure.
"""
class Stack():
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)				

    def pop(self):
        return self.items.pop()
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return self.items == []
    
    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items[-1]
        
    def get_stack(self):
        return self.items
       
```

#### Determine if brackets are balanced

A balanced set of brackets is one where the number and type of opening and closing brackets match and that is also properly nested within the string of brackets.

##### Examples of balanced brackets

- { }
- { } { }
- ( ( { [ ] } ) )

##### Examples of unbalanced brackets

- ( ( )
- { { { ) } ]
- `[ ] [ ]` ] ]

##### Algorithm

- We iterate through the characters of the string.
- If we get an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
- If we encounter a closing bracket, pop off an element from the stack and match it with the closing bracket. If it is an opening bracket and of the same type as the closing bracket, we conclude it is a successful match and move on. If itâ€™s not, we will conclude that the set of brackets is not balanced.
- The stack will be empty at the end of iteration for a balanced example of brackets while weâ€™ll be left with some elements in the stack for an unbalanced example.

###### Special case

Example: ) )

In the case described above we don't have an opening parenthesis, but we encounter a closing parenthesis. In this case, we immediately know that the string does not have a balanced usage of brackets.

Let's implement the algorithm in Python, starting with the **is_paren_balanced** function:

```python
def is_paren_balanced(paren_string):
  s = Stack()
  is_balanced = True
  index = 0
  
  while index < len(paren_string) and is_balanced:
    paren = paren_string[index]
    if paren in "([{":
      s.push(paren)
    else:
      if s.is_empty():
        is_balanced = False
        break
      else:
        top = s.pop()
        if not is_match(top, paren)
          is_balanced = False
          break
    index += 1
    
  if s.is_empty() and is_balanced:
    return True
  else:
    return False
    
```

Let's implement the **is_match** function now:

```python
def is_match(p1, p2):
    if p1 == "(" and p2 == ")":
        return True
    elif p1 == "{" and p2 == "}":
        return True
    elif p1 == "[" and p2 == "]":
        return True
    else:
        return False
        
```        

#### Reverse string

In Python, you can reverse a string very easily. For example,

```python
input_str = "Educative"
print(input_str[::-1])
```

##### Implementation with stack

```python
from stack import Stack
def reverse_string(stack, input_str):
  for i in range(len(input_str)):
    stack.push(input_str[i])
  rev_str = ""
  while not stack.is_empty():
    rev_str += stack.pop()

  return rev_str

stack = Stack()
input_str = "!evitacudE ot emocleW"
print(reverse_string(stack, input_str))
```

Output: `Welcome to Educative!`

I made a little modification in the code and it worked as well.

```python
from stack import Stack
def reverse_string(input_str):
  stack = Stack()
  for i in range(len(input_str)):
    stack.push(input_str[i])
  rev_str = ""
  while not stack.is_empty():
    rev_str += stack.pop()

  return rev_str

input_str = "!evitacudE ot emocleW"
print(reverse_string(input_str))
```

### Singly linked lists

We will go over the following different types of linked lists and implement them in Python:

1. Singly linked lists
2. Doubly linked lists
3. Circular linked lists

Below is a simple depiction of a singly linked list:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180621233-8912fb42-8d41-4819-8339-68a199fc434c.png"/>
</p>

#### Structure

Every linked list consists of nodes. Every node has two components:

1. Data
2. Next

- The _data_ component allows a node in the linked list to store an element of data that can be of type string, character, number or any other type of object.
- The _next_ component in every node is a pointer that points from one node to another.
- The start of the linked list is referred to as the **head**. It is a pointer that points to the beginning of the linked list, so if we want to traverse the linked list to obtain or access an element of the linked list, we'll start from head and move along.
- The last component of a singly linked list is a notion of null. This null idea terminates the linked list. In Python, we call this **None**. The last node in a singly linked list points to a null object, and that tells you that it's the end of the linked list.

#### Arrays vs. linked lists

|                                                   | Arrays | Linked lists |
|:-------------------------------------------------:|:------:|:------------:|
| Insertion/deletion at the beginning given a value |  O(n)  |     O(1)     |
|                   Access element                  |  O(1)  |     O(n)     |
|                 Contiguous memory                 |   Yes  |      No      |

##### Insertion/deletion

The insertion/deletion operation is in O(n) operations for insertion/deletion of value at the beginning of the array. Now think if we are given an array and a value to insert at the beginning of an array. For insertion, we have to shift all the elements in the array to the right. Due to the shifting, the time complexity is O(n). The same is valid for deletion. 

Inserting a node at the head of a linked list given the head node is a constant-time operation as we need to change the orientation of a few pointers. If we are given the exact pointer after which we have to insert another node, it will be a constant-time operation.

##### Accessing elements

Accessing any element given an index in arrays is better than accessing nth elements in linked lists. It is a constant time operation to access elements in arrays. This is because arrays are contiguous. 

In a linked list, if we want to access an element, we need to start from the head pointer and traverse the entire linked list before we can get to it.

##### Contiguous memory

Arrays are contiguous in memory which allows the access time to be constant, whereas, in linked lists, you do not have the luxury of contiguous memory.

#### Implementation

Now let's go ahead and create our classes in Python:

- Node class
- LinkedList class

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self, data):
    self.data = data
    self.next = None
    
class LinkedList:
  def __init__(self):
    self.head = None
    
```
