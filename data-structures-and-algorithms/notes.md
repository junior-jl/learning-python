# Data structures and algorithms in Python

A data structure is a way to storing and organizing data according to a certain format or structure.

## Data structures in Python

Python is equipped with several built-in data structures to help us efficiently handle large amounts of data.

The four primary built-in data structures offered in Python3 are:

- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Set

### Lists

#### Structure

The list is perhaps the most commonly used data structure in Python. It allows us to store elements of different data types in one container.

The contents of a list are enclosed by square brackets, [ ].

Lists are _ordered_, like strings. Elements are stored linearly at a specific index.

<p align="center">

</p>

A string was a collection of characters indexed in a linear fashion. A list is the same except that it can contain any type of data, even another list!

#### Creating a list

```python
jon_snow = ["Jon Snow", "Winterfell", 30]
print(jon_snow)

# Indexing
print(jon_snow[0])

# Length
print(len(jon_snow))

```

Output:

```
['Jon Snow', 'Winterfell', 30]
Jon Snow
3
```

The beauty of lists lies in the fact that we are not bound to one type of data. Lists are mutable, which further expands their functionality:

```python
jon_snow = ["Jon Snow", "Winterfell", 30]
print(jon_snow[2])
jon_snow[2] += 3
print(jon_snow[2])
```

#### Using range()

A range can further be converted into a list by using the list() casting.

```python
num_seq = range(0, 10)  # A sequence from 0 to 9
num_list = list(num_seq)  # The list() method casts the sequence into a list
print(num_list)

num_seq = range(3, 20, 3)  # A sequence from 3 to 19 with a step of 3
print(list(num_seq))
```

#### List-ception!

Here's an example of lists inside another list:

```python
world_cup_winners = [[2006, "Italy"], [2010, "Spain"],
                     [2014, "Germany"], [2018, "France"]]
print(world_cup_winners)
```

Output:

```
[[2006, 'Italy'], [2010, 'Spain'], [2014, 'Germany'], [2018, 'France']]
```

##### Sequential indexing

To access the elements of a list or a string which exists inside another list, we can use the concept of sequential indexing.

```python
world_cup_winners = [[2006, "Italy"], [2010, "Spain"],
                     [2014, "Germany"], [2018, "France"]]
print(world_cup_winners[1])
print(world_cup_winners[1][1])  # Accessing 'Spain'
print(world_cup_winners[1][1][0])  # Accessing 'S'
```

#### Merging lists

The simplest way is to use the + operator like we did for strings:

```python
part_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
part_B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
merged_list = part_A + part_B
print(merged_list)
```

Output:

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```

Alternatively, we could use the **extend()** property of a list to add the elements of one list at the end of another.

```python
part_A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
part_B = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
part_A.extend(part_B)
print(part_A)
```

#### Common list operations

##### Adding elements

The **append()** method can be used to add a new element at the end of a list.

```
a_list.append(newElement)
```

Example:

```python
num_list = []  # Empty list
num_list.append(1)
num_list.append(2)
num_list.append(3)
print(num_list)
```

In the code above, we create an empty list. This can always be done by simply using empty square brackets [ ].

To add an element at a particular index in the list, we can use the **inser()** method.

```
aList.insert(index, newElement)
```

If a value already exists at that index, the whole list from that value onwards will be shifted one step to the right:

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
num_list.insert(3, 4)  # Inserting 4 at the 3rd index. 5 and 6 shifted ahead
print(num_list)
```

##### Removing elements

The counterpart of **append()** is **pop()**, which removes the last element from the list. We can store this popped element in a variable.

```python
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
last_house = houses.pop()
print(last_house)
print(houses)
```

If we need to delete a particular value from a list, we can use the **remove()** method.

```
aList.remove(element_to_be_deleted)
```

```python
houses = ["Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin"]
print(houses)
houses.remove("Ravenclaw")
print(houses)

# For nested lists
populations = [["Winterfell", 10000], ["King's Landing", 50000],
               ["Iron Islands", 5000]]
print(populations)
populations.remove(["King's Landing", 50000])
print(populations)
```

Output:

```
['Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Ravenclaw', 'Slytherin', 'Ravenclaw']
['Gryffindor', 'Hufflepuff', 'Slytherin', 'Ravenclaw']
[['Winterfell', 10000], ["King's Landing", 50000], ['Iron Islands', 5000]]
[['Winterfell', 10000], ['Iron Islands', 5000]]
```

##### List slicing

It is used to obtain a portion of a list given the start and end indices. Slicing a list gives us a sublist:

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
print(num_list[2:5])
print(num_list[0::2])
```

Output:

```
[3, 4, 5]
[1, 3, 5, 7]
```

##### Index search

With lists its really easy to access a value through its index. However, the opposite operation is also possible where we can find the index of a given value.

For this, weâ€™ll use the **index()** method:

```python
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Beirut"]
print(cities.index("Los Angeles"))  # It is at the 2nd index
```

Output : 2

If we just want to verify the existence of an element in a list, we can use the in operator:

```python
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Beirut"]
print("London" in cities)
print("Moscow" not in cities)
```

Output:

```
True
True
```

##### List sort

A list can be sorted in ascending order using the **sort()** method. Sorting can be done alphabetically or numerically depending on the content of the list:

```python
num_list = [20, 40, 10, 50.4, 30, 100, 5]
num_list.sort()
print(num_list)
```

Output:

```
[5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50.4, 100]
```

#### List comprehension

List comprehension is a technique that uses a for loop and a condition to create a new list from an existing one. The result is always a new list, so it's a good practice to assign list comprehension to a new variable.

##### Structure

```
[expression for loop if condition]
```

- The **expression** is an operation used to create elements in the new list.
- The **for** **loop** will iterate an existing list. The iterator will be used in the **expression**.
- New elements will only be added to the new list when the **if condition** is fulfilled. This component is optional.

Example:

Let's create a new list whose values are the doubles of the values of an existing list.

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
nums_double = []

for n in nums:
  nums_double.append(n * 2)
  
```

Let's break down the loop above into the three components of a list comprehension. The expression is equivalent to ** n \* 2** since it's used to create each value in the new list.

Our for loop is **for n in nums**, where **n** is the iterator.

An if condition doesn't exist in this case.

Converting...

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# List comprehension
nums_double = [n * 2 for n in nums]

```

We could add a condition:

```python
nums = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# List comprehension
nums_double = [n * 2 for n in nums if n % 4 == 0]

```

##### Using multiple lists

List comprehension can also be performed on more than one list. The number of for loops in the comprehension will correspond to the number of lists we're using.

Let's write a list comprehension which creates tuples out of the values in two lists when their sum is greater than 100. These tuples are the elemnents of the new list.

```python
list1 = [30, 50, 110, 40, 15, 75]
list2 = [10, 60, 20, 50]

sum_list = [(n1, n2) for n1 in list1 for n2 in list2 if n1 + n2 > 100]
```

### Tuples

#### Structure

A tuple is very similar to a list, except for the fact that its contents cannot be changed. In other words, a tuple is **immutable**. However, it can contain mutable elements like a list. These elements can be altered.

The contents of a tuple are enclosed in parentheses, (). They are also ordered.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180579633-4eb93f46-e11d-4f45-9c10-244b48abe5bb.png"/>
</p>


#### Creating a tuple

Tuples can be created similar to lists. All the indexing and slicing operations apply to it as well:

```python
car = ("Ford", "Raptor", 2019, "Red")
print(car)

# Length
print(len(car))

# Indexing
print(car[1])

# Slicing
print(car[2:])
```

Output:

```
('Ford', 'Raptor', 2019, 'Red')
4
Raptor
(2019, 'Red')
```

#### Merging tuples

Tuples can be merged using the + operator.

#### Nested tuples

Instead of merging two tuples, we can create a new tuple with tuples as its members.

```python
hero1 = ("Batman", "Bruce Wayne")
hero2 = ("Wonder Woman", "Diana Prince")
awesome_team = (hero1, hero2)
print(awesome_team)
```

Output:

```
(('Batman', 'Bruce Wayne'), ('Wonder Woman', 'Diana Prince'))
```

#### Search

We can check whether an element exists in a tuple by using the **in** operator as well.

The **index()** function can give us the index of a particular value:

```python
cities = ("London", "Paris", "Los Angeles", "Tokyo")
print(cities.index("Tokyo"))
```

Output: 3

#### Immutability

Since tuples are immutable, we can't add or delete elements from them. Furthermore, it isn't possible to append another tuple to an existing tuple.

### Dictionaries

#### Structure

It has a slightly more complex structure.

A **dictionary** stores **key-value** pairs, where each unique key is an **index** which holds the value associated with it.

Dictionaries are **unordered**. In Python, we must put the dictionary's content inside curly brackets, {}.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180580056-5ffc3f1a-6a14-4034-bf29-95ac2293a99f.png"/>
</p>

A key-value pair is written in the following format:

```
key:value
```

#### Creating a dictionary

Let's create an empty dictionary and a simple **phone_book** using the dictionary data structure.

```python
empty_dict = {} # Empty dictionary
print(empty_dict)

phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book) 
```

Output:

```
{}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734}
```

Note that since the dictionary is an unordered data structure, the order of the output will not necessarily match the order in which we wrote the entries. Key-value pairs are accessed in a random or unordered manner. 

The dictionary above could also be written in the same line. Dividing it into lines only increases readability.

#### The dict() constructor

Don't worry about the term constructor for now. Think of it as an operation which gives us a dictionary.

If our keys are simple strings without special characters, we can create entries in the constructor. In that case, values will be assigned to keys using the = operator. A popular practice is to create an empty dictionary and add entries later.

Let's refactor the example above to make it work with dict().

```python
empty_dict = dict()  # Empty dictionary
print(empty_dict)

phone_book = dict(Batman=468426, Cersei=237734, Ghostbusters=44678)
# Keys will automatically be converted to strings
print(phone_book)

# Alternative approach
phone_book = dict([('Batman', 468426),
                   ('Cersei', 237734),
                   ('Ghostbusters', 44678)])
print(phone_book)
```

The **keys** and **values** can have any of the basic data types or structures we've studied. Two keys can have the same value. However, it is crucial that all keys are unique.

#### Accessing values

We can access a value by enclosing its key in square brackets [ ]. Alternatively, we can use the get() method as follows:

```
a_dictionary.get(key)
```

Let's build upon our previous example:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book["Cersei"])
print(phone_book.get("Ghostbusters"))
```

Output:

```
237734
44678
```

#### Dictionary operations

##### Adding/Updating entries

We can add entries in a dictionary by simply assigning a value to a key. Python automatically creates the entry. If a value already exists at this key, it will be updated:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book)

phone_book["Godzilla"] = 46394  # New entry
print(phone_book)

phone_book["Godzilla"] = 9000  # Updating entry
print(phone_book)
```

Output:

```
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Godzilla': 46394, 'Cersei': 237734}
{'Ghostbusters': 44678, 'Batman': 468426, 'Godzilla': 9000, 'Cersei': 237734}
```

##### Removing entries

To delete an entry, we can use the **del** keyword.

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book)

del phone_book["Batman"]
print(phone_book)
```

If we want to use the deleted value, the pop() or popitem() methods would work better:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(phone_book)

cersei = phone_book.pop("Cersei")
print(phone_book)
print(cersei)

# Removes and returns the last inserted pair, as a tuple
# In Python versions before 3.7, popitem() removes and returns the random item
lastAdded = phone_book.popitem()
print(lastAdded)
```

Output:

```
{'Batman': 468426, 'Cersei': 237734, 'Ghostbusters': 44678}
{'Batman': 468426, 'Ghostbusters': 44678}
237734
('Ghostbusters', 44678)
```

##### Length of a dictionary

Similar to lists and tuples, we can calculate the length of a dictionary using **len()**:

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}
print(len(phone_book))
```

##### Checking key existence

The in keyword can be used to check if a key exists in a dictionary.

##### Copying contents

To copy the contents of one dictionary to another, we can use the **update()** operation.

```python
phone_book = {"Batman": 468426,
              "Cersei": 237734,
              "Ghostbusters": 44678}

second_phone_book = {"Catwoman": 67423, "Jaime": 237734, "Godzilla": 37623}

# Add secondphone_book to phone_book
phone_book.update(second_phone_book)
print(phone_book)
```

##### Dictionary comprehension

It works very similar to list comprehensions. However, to iterate the dictionary, we'll use the **dict.items()** operation which turns a dictionary into a list of **(key, value)** tuples. Here's a simple example where the keys of the original dictionary are squared and '!' is appended to each string value:

```python
houses = {1: "Gryffindor", 2: "Slytherin", 3: "Hufflepuff", 4: "Ravenclaw"}
new_houses = {n**2: house + "!" for (n, house) in houses.items()}
print(houses)
print(new_houses)
```

Output:

```
{1: 'Gryffindor', 2: 'Slytherin', 3: 'Hufflepuff', 4: 'Ravenclaw'}
{16: 'Ravenclaw!', 1: 'Gryffindor!', 4: 'Slytherin!', 9: 'Hufflepuff!'}
```

### Sets

A set is an unordered collection of data items.

The data is not indexed, so we can't access elements using indices or get(). This is probably the simplest data structure in Python. We can think of it as a bag containing random items.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581245-f7adef2e-09de-4275-90f0-460cdf5a2385.png"/>
</p>

Mutable data structures like lists or dictionaries can't be added to a set. However, adding a tuple is perfectly fine. A set is perfect when we simply need to keep track of the existence of items.

It doesn't allow duplicates, which means that we can convert another data structure to a set to remove any duplicates.

#### Creating a set

The contents of a set are encapsulated in curly brackets, {}. Like all data structures, the length of a set can be calculated using len().

#### The set() constructor

It is an alternate way of creating sets.

```python
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)

random_set = set({"Educative", 1408, 3.142, (True, False)})
print(random_set)
```

Output:

```
set()
{1408, (True, False), 3.142, 'Educative'}
```

#### Adding elements

To add a single item, we can use the **add()** method. To add multiple items, we'd have to use **update()**.

The input for update() must be another set, list, tuple, or string.

```python
empty_set = set()
print(empty_set)

empty_set.add("hi")
print(empty_set)

empty_set.update([2, 3, 4, 5, 6], "hi")
print(empty_set)
```

Output:

```
set()
{'hi'}
{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 'hi', 'i', 'h'}
```

#### Deleting elements

The **discard()** or **remove()** operations can be used to delete a particular item from a set.

```python
random_set = set({"Educative", 1408, 3.142, (True, False)})
print(random_set)

random_set.discard(1408)
print(random_set)

random_set.remove((True, False))
print(random_set)
```

The **remove()** method generates an error if the item is not found, unlike the **discard()** method.

#### Iterating a set

The **for** loop can be used on unordered data structures like sets. However, we wouldnâ€™t know the order in which the iterator moves meaning elements will be picked randomly.

In the example below, weâ€™ll take the elements of a set and append them to a list if they are odd:

```python
odd_list = [1, 3, 5, 7]
unordered_set = {9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}

print(unordered_set)

for num in unordered_set:
    if(not num % 2 == 0):
        odd_list.append(num)

print(odd_list)
```

Output:

```
{9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17}
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17]
```

#### Set theory operations

- Union
- Intersection
- Difference

##### Union

A union of two sets is the collection of all unique elements from both sets.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581675-facb74a2-505f-4c48-979d-653b9ceb9b4b.png"/>
</p>

In Python, union can be performed using either the pipe operator \|, or the **union()** method.

```python
set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_B = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'}

print(set_A | set_B)
print(set_A.union(set_B))
print(set_B.union(set_A))
```

Output:

```
{1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b'}
{1, 2, 3, 4, 'a', 'd', 'c', 'b'}
{'a', 1, 2, 3, 4, 'd', 'c', 'b'}
```

##### Intersection

The intersection of two sets is the collection of unique elements which are common between them.

In Python, intersection can be performed using either the \& operator or the **intersection()** method.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581806-b5d4ceed-3516-46fa-8fc8-0eeec540e245.png"/>
</p>

```python
set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_B = {2, 8, 4, 16}

print(set_A & set_B)
print(set_A.intersection(set_B))
print(set_B.intersection(set_A))
```

Output:

```
{2, 4}
{2, 4}
{2, 4}
```

##### Difference

The difference between two sets is the collection of all unique elements present in the first set but not in the second.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69206952/180581868-ec67c958-dff5-47d9-bb05-40f60974bef7.png"/>
</p>

          
In Python, the difference between two sets can be found using either the - operator or the **difference()** method.

```python
set_A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_B = {2, 8, 4, 16}


print(set_A - set_B)
print(set_A.difference(set_B))

print(set_B - set_A)
print(set_B.difference(set_A))
```

Output:

```
{1, 3}
{1, 3}
{16, 8}
{16, 8}
```
