# You are given a list called my_list. Using this list, you must create a tuple called my_tuple. The tuple will contain the listâ€™s first element,
# last element, and the length of the list, in that same order.

# My solution

my_tuple = (my_list[0], my_list[len(my_list) - 1], len(my_list))

# Educative solution was the same.
